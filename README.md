## ExploringPlanets App

<h2 style="color: blue"></h2>

<p>
Thanks to the efforts put forth by brave explorers, we live in an era where the human
race will become a multi-planet species. One of the challenges for doing this is keeping
track of the status of each expedition that traverses multiple unknown solar systems in
order to find life.
We plan to create an application that models the expedition process so that we can
keep track of the planets that were visited, and the status of each of these planets.
Each planet in the solar system is visited by a team of explorers composed of one
human captain and multiple robots that board a shuttle and navigate the solar system
for finding planets that can sustain life. When reaching a planet, the robots can
determine whether it is suitable for human life or not. The human captain can use the
application in order to communicate the status of the expedition to the other exploring
teams, so that they do not visit the same planet again.

<p>
The user interface for the application should be a web based, single page application
that runs on phone resolution, written in whatever is most convenient ( Angular , React ,
Vue or without any frameworks, and should look something like):
